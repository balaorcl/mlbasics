        "\n",
        "In this course, we will walk through the full data science life cycle, from data cleaning and feature selection to machine learning. we will focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focusses on modelling a borrowers's [credit risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk).\n",
        "\n",
        "Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the begining of commerce.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll be working financial lending data from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/). \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Lending Club\n",
        "Lending Club is a marketplace for personals loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Borrower\n",
        "Higher interest rate means that borrower is risky and more likely not to pay back the loan. Lower interest rate means the borrower has good credit history and more likely to pay back the loan. Interest rate range from 6.46% to 17.74% and each borrower is given a grade. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Investor\n",
        "Investors are primarily interested in receiving a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose of the loan, and other loan information from the application. Once they are ready to support a loan request, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan request amount is fully \n",
        "funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the [origination fee](https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/214463677) that the Lending Club charges.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Business Process\n",
        "\n",
        "Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data (and their own data science process!) and assign an interest rate to the borrower. The borrower has to pay back with interest rate. You can read more about the interest rate that Lending Club assigns [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/loans/personal-loans/rates-fees?). Lending club also tries to verify the borrower information, but due to regulation reasons it cannot verify all the borrower information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The borrower makes monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off before they see return in money. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return with respect to the interest rate. Many loans are not completely paid off on time, and some borrowers default the loan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following is the diagram from [Bible Money Matters](https://www.biblemoneymatters.com/introduction-to-peer-to-peer-lending-signing-up-to-use-lending-club/)\n",

        "#### Assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "Lending Club should have effective credit modelling and the investors also should be very careful to determine which loans are likely to be paid off. We may assume that investors will put money into low interest loans, but the returns from high interest loans is very good but with a risk. Most investors use a strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. We will understand the dataset features, build a machine learning model which will predict if a loan will be paid or not.\n"
